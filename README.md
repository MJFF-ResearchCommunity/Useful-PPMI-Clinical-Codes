# Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook encompassess a series of scripts written in Python by Daniel Teixeira dos Santos, a Data Community Innovator at the Data Community of Practice ([link to my forum account](https://rcop.michaeljfox.org/u/danieltds/summary)). These scripts were written using a Jupyter Notebook acessing local files that I downloaded from PPMI's LONI.

The goal of these scripts is to provide researchers some relevant clinical data that are extracted in a meaningful way form the data that is already available in PPMI. All the necessary input datasets can be obtained [here](https://ida.loni.usc.edu/pages/access/studyData.jsp?project=PPMI) after applying for registration for access to the PPMI data. All outputs from the analyses were removed to comply with privacy and data sharing principles. Some of these scripts were developed with the help of AI tools such as ChatGPT 4o.

What this notebook covers: (1) LEDD and medication-specific LEDD calculations, (2) levodopa challenge responsiveness, (3) medical conditions identifier, (4) medication usage identifier, (5) longitudinal DBS evolution, (6) longitudinal deceased status and (7) the creation of a longitudinal and integrated MDS-UPDRS scores alongside minimal clinically important differences analyses.

Other analyses are also planned to be added.
